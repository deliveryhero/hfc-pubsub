PubSub is a lightweight framework and subscription server for [Google Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub). It was created to speed up development time ‚ö°Ô∏è and it provides a common foundation for building event driven applications. It lets developers define topics and subscriptions simply and declaratively, while additionally offering a simple subscription server to run all of a project's subscription handlers.
